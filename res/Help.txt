Please run RC Tank software (executable file must be installed to Raspberry Pi OS)
with the following command line options:
--cfg=<path_to_file>  /* mandatory */
    Absolute or relative path to device configuration file. It is about wiring to
    Raspberry's GPIO pins.
[obsolete] --ctrl={keyboard || wifi || irrc || radio}
    keyboard: is a keyboard+mouse (if available) dongle attached rigth to the
        Raspberry's USB ports.
    wifi_usb: if a WiFi transceiver is available it is being used for listening, if
        it is not RC Tank will fail to start. It is about an USB-based WiFi 
        transmitter.
    wifi_gpio: if a WiFi transceiver is available it is being used for listening, if
        it is not RC Tank will fail to start. It is about a GPIO-based WiFi 
        transmitter.
    irrc: IR remote control of your TV. IR transceiver (or receiver) must be available.
    radio: XX MHz radio transceiver (or receiver). A GPIO-based device of corresponding
        type must be available.
    blue_usb: <a USB Blue-Tooth transceiver>.
    blue_gpio: <a GPIO-based Blue-Tooth transceiver>.
--assert_gpio=<GPIO number>
    WiringPi pin numbering is used. 0 .. 29 values are allowed (please check WiringPi
    docs).
--profile=<path_to_file>
    Absolute or relative path to profile file.
--log=<path_to_file>
    Absolute or relative path to Logger's log-file. If defined, it will be used anyway (see
	the "--logger=" param).
--logger={std || pipe}
    Use '+' to join optional values.
	std: stdout.
	pipe: transmit to separate process over a standard pipe.
