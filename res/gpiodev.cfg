// Pin/GPIO order in brackets is essential, so keep it as specified below.
// Here is a list of device types with in-place description of pins they have. [] means a non-mandatory
// pin which can be omitted (and it is better to do so in most of cases).
//
// Device types:
// * LED (power_1.7v, [ground])
// * RGBLED (power_1.7v as RED, power_1.7v as GREEN, power_1.7v as BLUE, [ground])
// * RPICAM ()  // basically, it doesn't use any GPIO
// * Transmission (In-1, In-2, In-3, In-4, En-A, En-B)
//
// Pin/GPIO can be specified in any of way described below. Despite it is much easier to support
// just one of them (C strings are so painful =( ), all of them were supported for flexibility.
// Check syntax among 'numbering methods below'.
//
// Pin numbering methods:
// * Board pin numbering -- a pin numbering in order they take place on a Raspberry Pi board; on a
//   Raspberry Pi A+ it is from 1 to 40 (see the board spec). Syntax:
//   >> 15  // just a number means a pin number
//   >> PIN15  // explicit keyword "PIN", '-' or '_' can be used as a delimiter:
//   >> PIN-15, PIN_15
// * WiringPi GPIO pin numbering -- defined by the WiringPi/Pi4J library. See appropriate spec for
//   details. Syntax for the same pin 15 is the following:
//   >> GPIO3  // explicit keyword "GPIO", '-' or '_' can be used as a delimiter:
//   >> GPIO-3, GPIO_3
//
// Examples:
//   my_led = LED(GPIO-3)    // my red led

led = LED (36)

transmsn = Transmission(13, 15, 16, 18, 33, 32)
